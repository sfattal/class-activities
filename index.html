        <li>Despite their names, naked mole rats are neither moles nor rats (nor are they totally hairless). They are more closely related to porcupines and guinea pigs.</li>
        <li>Naked mole rats live in the horn of Africa and are native to Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya.</li>
        <li>They are one of only two mammal species that are eusocial. Eusociality, a type of social organization in which individuals live in a hierarchy, is more familiarly found in insects like ants and wasps. There is a queen mole rat, soldiers and workers. (The other eusocial mammal species is another type of mole rat.)</li>
        <li>Soldier mole rats defend the colony from both predators—mostly snakes—and foreign mole rats, which they identify as foreign by their odor.</li>
        <li>Worker mole rats are celibate and spend most of their time digging.</li>
